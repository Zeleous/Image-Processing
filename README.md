This repository contains the code for a deep learning model that detects whether a person is wearing glasses in an image.

Project Overview:

    Goal: Develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to accurately classify images of people as "wearing glasses" or "not wearing glasses."
    Methodology:
        Data Collection and Preparation: Collected and prepared a dataset of images with and without glasses, including data augmentation techniques.
        Model Architecture: Designed and implemented a CNN model using TensorFlow/Keras, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
        Model Training: Trained the model on the prepared dataset, monitoring performance and adjusting hyperparameters as needed.
        Model Evaluation: Evaluated the trained model on a held-out test set to assess its accuracy and generalization ability.

Project Structure:

    detector.py: Python script containing the code for training the CNN model.
    Predict.py: Python script for loading the trained model and making predictions on new images.
    images/: Directory containing the image dataset:
        train/: Subdirectory containing training images.
        validation/: Subdirectory containing validation images.
        test/: Subdirectory containing test images.
    glasses_detection_model.h5: Saved model file.

How to Run:

    Install dependencies:
    Bash

    pip install tensorflow keras

    Train the model:
        Run detector.py to train the model. This will create the glasses_detection_model.h5 file.

    Make predictions:
        Modify the image_path in Predict.py to the path of the image you want to classify.
        Run Predict.py to get the prediction.

Results:

    > 90% accuracy on the test set.
 

Future Work:

    Improve accuracy: Experiment with different model architectures, hyperparameters, and data augmentation techniques.
    Real-time inference: Optimize the model for real-time performance.
    Explore transfer learning: Utilize pre-trained models like MobileNet or ResNet for potential performance gains.
